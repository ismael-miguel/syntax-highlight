# Simple syntax highlighter
Allows you to easily highlight the source code of multiple languages with minimal changes and configurations.

## How to use

- Javascript
  - Simply include the Javascript file, the language file and the associated files with the language.
  - Optionally, you can compile all the css files into one.
  - Call `highlight('lang', elem);`.
  - And you are done!
- PHP
  - A version for PHP will be created in the future.

Each implementation has it's own language list compatibility.
